### What I learned

Where to begin!

This is the first project I ever did from scratch. I have been learning web development for about 6 months and I wanted to build something. This is an initiative tracker for a TTRPG that my partner plays. I thought it would be a fun way to start!

This project is built on vanilla JS. I wanted to keep it that way for this version so that I would gain a deeper knowledge of the language. My largest takeaway was with organization of the code. I started using modules and really got to see how meesy code can get as I developed the project. I still think it's messy, but I am going to leave it as is because I want to compare it to the next version, which I have a lot of ideas about.

I took a few weeks away from this project to do some other training projects, and when I came back to it I laughed at myself. The way I learned to structure my CSS has changed dramatically and it was really something to look back at what I was doing. In general, I don't think I notated well and am still learning what organized code looks like and how to do it. 

The problem solving aspect of the project was very fun for me. I found I really enjoyed working out the kinks in the program and getting stuff to function. I spent a lot of time on MDN, stackoverflow, and chatGPT. I feel much more comfortable tackling the next project.

### Continued development

Version 2 - Now that I have more knowledge, I am going to build this from the ground up with react. I think it will be a much smoother app using react and I can get away from local storage. I am going to get it to a point where people can log in, set up games, and access them from different devices. There is still much for me to learn to do that, so I am not sure how long it will take, but that's the fun of it!
